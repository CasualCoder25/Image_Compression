# Image_Compression

- This project deals with the internal working of K-Means algorithm
- This is an algorithm used for clustering and it comes under the unsupervised learning domain of machine learning
- Here I'm hand coding the entire implemention of this algorithm with the example of image_compression
- Please refer the `.ipynb` file for the code and the outputs 
- Outputs are also stored as `.jpg` in this repository for easy access
